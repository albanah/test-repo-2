Your valuable component can be offered to RBI Inner Source in step by step approach to make it easier to start. Depending on the usage of your component you should proceed to the next step.

<body> 
    <p> Fist Step: Visibility </p>
</body> 
<ol type="1">
    <li>Define a <a href="https://my-dev.rbi.tech/the-trusted-committer/"> <b>Trusted Committer</b></a> who knows the source code best</li>
  <li>Create <a href="https://my-dev.rbi.tech/the-inner-source-project-page"><b>The Inner Source Project Page</b></a> on <a href="https://my-dev.rbi.tech/"><b>rbi.tech</b></a> so others know what you have to offer for reuse. </li>
</ol>


Once you get response and other developers are interested into your offered components, it makes sense to go the next step:

<body> 
    <p> Second Step: Documentation</p>
</body> 
<ol start="3">
    <li>Create a product or component <a href="https://my-dev.rbi.tech/the-product-documentation/"> <b>documentation</b></a>. </li>
    
  <li>Create a <b> Getting started for your users</b></li>
</ol>


Finally consider your component not as exclusive but rather inclusive and open up yourself for contribution from others:

<body> 
    <p> Third Step: Community</p>
</body>
<ol start="5">
    <li>Setup a community and include <a href="https://my-dev.rbi.tech/the-contributor/"> <b> Contributors</b></a> in your your product or component</li>
    <li>Create a <b>Getting started for your contributors</b> </li>
    <li>Create <a href="https://my-dev.rbi.tech/the-house-rules/"> <b>House Rules</b></a> for your component or product. </li>
</ol>
